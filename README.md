# swgohGearSearch

I built a web scrapper using python's Beautiful Soup package to scrape data from swgoh.gg and saved it in a csv file.

I then imported the data to phpMyAdmin to create a SQL database table. I didn't practice any database management with this project; I just imported the data straight from the csv file.

I look to build a website with the data. As of right now I have a local host server using Apache, and am practicing building the frontend of the webpage.
